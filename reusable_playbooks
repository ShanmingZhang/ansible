Ansibleâ€™s playbooks: Creating Reusable Playbooks

* Reusable playbooks
   - ansible support reuse files and start to organize things
   - there are three ways to support the reuse of playbook
      +:  includes
      +:  imports
      +:  roles
  - includes and imports allow users to break up large playbooks into smaller files 
      +:  these smaller files can be used across multiple parent playbooks and multiple times within the same playbook.
  - roles allow more than just (not only) tasks to be packaged together and include variables, handlers, or even modules and other plugins.
  - roles can also be uploaded and shared via ansible galaxy. modules and other plugins.
